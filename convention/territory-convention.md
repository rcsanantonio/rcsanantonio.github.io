## What every Regnum Christi member should know about the 2023 Territorial Convention:

This November 2 - 5, Regnum Christi is holding a territorial convention in Chicago in preparation for the 2024 General Convention in Rome. As Regnum Christi members, this is an important moment as it is when we come together as a family to discern how we are being called by God to move forward in our mission. For more information, visit this RC [webpage](https://www.regnumchristi.org/en/timeline-the-road-to-the-2024-rc-general-convention/).

Each Locality will send one or more to represent their Locality.  San Antonio has [three candidates](delegate-candidates.html) and will vote to send one Delegate.

### WHO GETS TO ATTEND? 
Delegates will be elected from each of the four vocations of Regnum Christi: Legionaries of Christ, Consecrated Women of Regnum Christi, Lay Consecrated Men of Regnum Christi and affiliated lay members. Also, a number of people will attend the convention because of their office, e.g. territorial director. We expect just over 100 delegates in total.

 

### HOW WILL DELEGATES BE CHOSEN?
Each of the vocations will vote for the delegates they want to send to the convention. San Antonio has [three candidates]() and will send one delegate. 


### WHAT WILL THEY DO AT THE CONVENTION? 
Delegates will tackle two main themes during the convention, and then vote on which delegates from among themselves will represent our territory at the 2024 General Convention in Rome. The two broad themes of the convention include:
 - Examining the situation of the world and how Regnum Christi can better serve its needs, proposing priorities for going forward.
 - Looking at the implementation of the Federation itself to see how it is working and make any proposals necessary for helping it work better.
 

### HOW WILL DELEGATES PREPARE FOR THE CONVENTION? 
As the topics covered at the convention are deep and far-reaching, delegates (and any reserve-list delegates) will be asked to participate in a preparation program. This program will include activities ranging from reading submissions, participating in topic workshops, listening to presentations on topics, etc. The Delegate Preparation Program will begin in June.


### HOW CAN NON-DELEGATE OFFER THEIR INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVE INTO THE PROCESS? 
There are four ways to have your voice heard through contributions that will then be made available to the delegates:

 1 - Locality leaders have already made a major effort to discern the local reality and prepared a Locality One-Sheet.
 2 - Teams can review one or more of the nine discussion guides available online at this LINK - each on a different topic related to our mission - and submit their reflections. These reflections will be collated and made available to delegates.
 3 - Individuals can submit a personal reflection at this LINK.
 4 - Anyone can speak with their locality's delegate(s) to offer their insights and perspectives.
 

### WHO GETS TO BE A DELEGATE? 
Referring here to lay members only, you are considered a candidate to be a delegate if you indicated "WILLING" on your RC member registration form. Each RC director has the list of candidates for their locality. If you wish to change your status to "NOT WILLING", simply inform your RC director or email czentner@rcfed.org. You can only stand as a candidate in one locality.

 

### WHO GETS TO VOTE? 
Again, referring here to lay members only, all registered lay members get to vote. In May the territorial office will send a link (via Survey Monkey) to all registered lay members using the email addresses provided during registration. You will be asked to select up to three people. If you have yet to officially register, you can ask your section director for the link.

### WHO SHOULD WE VOTE FOR AS DELEGATE? 

Again, referring here to lay members only, we recommend that you vote for those candidates who can represent the locality well in strategic discussions related to our evangelizing mission and the roll-out of the Federation. Ideally, the delegate will have had broad exposure to the mission and be passionate about their vocation. For localities sending more than one delegate, it would be helpful to have male and female representatives from different age groups.


### WHAT IS SOMEONE COMMITTING TO IF THEY GET ELECTED AS DELEGATE? 
Elected delegates are agreeing to attend the Territorial Convention in Chicago, November 2-5, 2023 and to actively participate in a delegate preparation program in advance. Should the delegate need to withdraw at some point during the process, the elected substitute will be invited to stand in.

### WHAT CAN I DO TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS OF THIS IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR? 
Three things: please pray for a generous outpouring of the Holy Spirit throughout this time of discernment, encourage active engagement of all RC members in the process, and of course, vote.
